Being really troubled by conventional business approaches and the lack of ecological awareness in the local rural area in south Peloponnese, she found her unique way of running her family business, weaving together Permaculture principles, Frederic Laloux approaches and her sociology background. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time she founded the Southern Lights non profit organization which goes many steps beyond the scope of the business, supporting farmers in converting to regenerative farming, creating learning opportunities for young and old on topics of regeneration, while bringing together the Greek regenerative movement in the Regen network she co-initiated. At the same time on her own regenerative agroforestry farm she is creating an invisible school for young and old to reconnect with nature in an abundant food forest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color:#5b9e73\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Webpage Links<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.guildapermaculture.com\/research\"><a href=\"http:\/\/silver-leaf.de\/?lang=de\">http:\/\/silver-leaf.de\/?lang=de <\/a><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesouthernlights.org\/\">http:\/\/www.thesouthernlights.org\/<\/a> <\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Talk: 13th October > &#8220;A regenerative business&#8221; Creating resilient and solidarity businesses with a regenerative impact needs transparency and approachability.
