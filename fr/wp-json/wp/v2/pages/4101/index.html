She found this in the ethics and integrated applied science of permaculture, and has been teaching permaculture ever since. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For almost 40 years Rosemary has worked extensively with farmers and villagers in Africa, Central and South East Asia and Eastern Europe. Rosemary has especially dedicated much of her efforts to people of war-torn nations such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Kurdistan and East Timor, refugees in Turkey, Bangladesh, Philippines, Malaysia, and to communities experiencing the serious effects of climate change like the Solomon Islands, and the effects of the Global Financial Crisis, like Spain, Greece and Portugal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color:#5b9e73\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Publications<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8220;The Earth User\u2019s Guide to Permaculture&#8221; &#8211; Kangaroo Press Pty.Ltd; New Edition (23.
