In particular Australia has been a mind changing experience as walking for weeks, month on remote farms the size of small countries in Europe showed me the dilemma with water, but also being one of the highest quality food producers in the world. It is such a controversial land and I believe we can learn more than permaculture from it. Hiking means also learning and it does not matter if you are 20 or 80 years old, it is something for anyone. I want to show the beauty of hiking, nature and share some stories like walking through a burned down rain forest in Tasmania. I recently moved to northern Italy and i am about to start a Hiker`s hostel following the permaculture principles in the Alps. I think many like-minded people\/hikers are into permaculture and want to share their story too. I was thinking of talking and showing some pictures for 30 minutes and having time for questions or exchange for another 30 minutes. I would love to hear your story!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeds for Sustainability is a company dedicated to sustainability and healthy living offering consulting services, event management, sustainability projects, and we run a school that offers training and courses based on cutting-edge research and industry knowledge.
