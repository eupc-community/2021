Our mission is to embody and enable loving responses to our predicament. With a network of volunteers and a tiny paid staff, Forum participants meet in local groups, in the Deep Adaptation Facebook Group and related groups, the Professions Network, a LinkedIn group, and the Deepadaptation.info website to learn together how to face collapse, using a framework of Resilience, Relinquishment, Restoration and Reconciliation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Terry LePage is a volunteer in the Forum who offers &#8220;Grief Gratitude and Courage,&#8221; and other circles where people can name and process their experience of Deep Adaptation. She is joined by Wendy Freeman, a volunteer who also practices permaculture, and Igor Polskiy, the Facilitation Coordinator for the Forum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color:#5b9e73\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Webpage Links<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/deepadaptation.info\/ \">http:\/\/deepadaptation.info\/ <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jembendell.com\/2019\/05\/15\/deep-adaptation-versions\/ \">https:\/\/jembendell.com\/2019\/05\/15\/deep-adaptation-versions\/ <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/deepadaptation\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/deepadaptation<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/deepadaptation.ning.com\/\">https:\/\/deepadaptation.ning.com\/<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Talk: 11th October > &#8220;Support &amp; well-being during social breakdowns&#8221; Many among us fear that to inquire about collapse will lead to paralyzing despair, and so we avoid it &#8211; knowing full well that it calls for our attention.
