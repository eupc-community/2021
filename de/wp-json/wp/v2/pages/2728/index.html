Movements such as Ecovillages, Permaculture, Transition, and many others, are good examples of that, and have a long experience building alternatives at community level. How can we foster collaboration and mutual learning among them, and with other key stakeholders, to increase the positive impact? How can we create healthy and transformative networks? ECOLISE, The European Network of Community-led Initiatives on Climate change and Sustainability, brings together many of these movements, and works on these and other important questions through the Communities for Future programme: an action programme that aims at the widespread mainstreaming of regenerative and transformative community-led action on climate change and sustainability in the period up to 2030 and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color:#5b9e73\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Biography<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan is the ECOLISE Network and outreach coordinator.
