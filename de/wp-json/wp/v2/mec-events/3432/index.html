Its aim was to build <g class=\"gr_ gr_28 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"28\" data-gr-id=\"28\">culture<\/g> of solidarity and food sovereignty in the midst of the lockdown of <g class=\"gr_ gr_29 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"29\" data-gr-id=\"29\">Covid-19<\/g> Pandemic, which altered our ability to communicate, meet and learn from each other, and connect to nature. The Supermarket Museum is an online exhibition full of interesting resources and narratives about the future of our food, that can be used for education, community awareness building and connecting permaculture curriculum to <g class=\"gr_ gr_33 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"33\" data-gr-id=\"33\">global<\/g> food situation. The project draws attention to the challenge of the coming food crisis, the fragility of the supermarket monopoly and today&#8217;s dominant model of industrial agriculture which undermine the unbreakable pact of trust between societies and ecosystems. We urgently need solutions that enable producing and enjoying healthier food, empower community food production <g class=\"gr_ gr_23 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"23\" data-gr-id=\"23\">and and<\/g> healing the planet so it can heal us in turn. That\u2019s why our project consists of two different yet corresponding paths \u2013 \u201cSupermarket Museum\u201d that tackles the problem of supermarket culture and <g class=\"gr_ gr_24 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"24\" data-gr-id=\"24\">second<\/g> one &#8211; \u201cGarden in your hands\u201d which presents successful alternatives to it: agroecology, permaculture or food sovereignty. And it is this second part that we want to devote our speech <g class=\"gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"18\" data-gr-id=\"18\">bis<\/g>. During our online tour through the online map, we will present these new solutions in the field of food-growing and ecological education to inspire educators from around the world to introduce new methods in their work. \u201cThe Garden in your hands\u201d path of the web-doc presents variety of ongoing projects that promise sustainable and renewable innovations. Its easy to navigate interface is constructed to raise awareness about these issues. Let&#8217;s walk <g class=\"gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"20\" data-gr-id=\"20\">those path<\/g> together.
