After 5 years of developing urban Permaculture projects in the city of Athens, we relocated our activity at a small suburban farm, which over the years has been turned into a productive human ecosystem that operates as a research and educational centre for Mediterranean Permaculture. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to explore new, healthy and meaningful connections with nature and people around us, facilitating the emergence of a new local culture based on solidarity and respect for life as a whole. The Nea Guinea team runs the farm, designs for other land based projects and organizes educational activities, open informative events, gatherings, festivals and work exchange programs for locals, refugees and internationals of all ages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color:#5b9e73\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Webpage Links<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/neaguinea.org\">https:\/\/neaguinea.org<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Talk: 11th October > &#8220;Resilience and Abundance in Times of Crisis&#8221; Biography Fotini Georgousi is a biologist, farmer, permaculturist and community activist from Athens, Greece.
